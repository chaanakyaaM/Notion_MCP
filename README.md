# üß† Notion MCP ‚Äì Model Context Protocol for Notion Integration
Notion MCP is a simple, Python-based MCP server that connects the Notion with tools built using MCP (Model Context Protocol).

It allows AI agents and large language models to interact with Notion in a structured, modular, and context-aware way.
